# Pitch Estimation Project

This project implements multiple algorithms for pitch estimation from an audio signal. The techniques demonstrated include:
- Autocorrelation
- Average Magnitude Difference Function (AMDF)
- Cepstrum Analysis

The project includes Python scripts to perform pitch estimation and analyze their performance using a sample audio input.

## Features
1. **Pitch Estimation**:
   - Implemented using three different methods: Autocorrelation, AMDF, and Cepstrum.
2. **Input Audio Processing**:
   - A sample audio file (`Input_audio.wav`) is included for testing.
3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - Results are analyzed and compared in the accompanying report.
